# Project 2: Green Screen
## Project Description and Criteria

**Due Thursday, March 11, 2021 (week 9)**

What is a green screen? We often see a green screen in a 'behind the scenes' or 'making of' for our favorite films.

Green screens allow film productions to visually place actors anywhere in our imaginable universe, which in turn allows our society to expand the limits of the stories we're able to tell through film. An audience of a film often only sees the result of the use of the green screen and not the 'behind the scenes' and has a different [phenomenological experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(psychology) of the space being created than the actor being filmed.

Zoom, the video conference tool we currently use for most classes, has a built in [virtual background](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background) feature which is able to place us anywhere we'd like during a meeting.

For this project you will create a video using any technique and tool of your choice that will become the background environment for Zoom. You will demo the video background in a Zoom session, using a screen recording application to capture the results. The demo video should be long enough to see your background loop (approximately 2 to 3 minutes).

**Requirements**
* Using a video editor of your choice (like Adobe Premiere, which will have a lab/tutorial on in week 7), create a video that is 1 minute long
* It must alter our perception of your space in some way (even in a very subtle way), or it must take us to an entirely new space
* You can record the video yourself or you can [appropriate](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/appropriation) video (or a sequence of images) and edit it to make it your own
* You can think at human scale or you can think small (model making?) or huge (space, planets, giants)
* The virtual background must be enabled, and a demo video of it in use recorded using screen capture software ([for Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721), [for Windows](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-capture-video-clips-in-windows-10), using [Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721), [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud/tools/screen-recorder.html?red=a)), or [another 3rd party application](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-record-your-screen)).
