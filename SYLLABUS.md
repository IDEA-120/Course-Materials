### Course Format, Zoom Meeting Details

IDEA 120 is a [semi-synchronous class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_learning) with required discussions on Thursdays and open office hours on Tuesdays. One-on-one meetings can be scheduled through Calendly (see info below). Depending on the progress and general mood of the class, attendance may sometimes be required on Tuesdays, but at least one week's notice.

Extensive computer and internet use is required. If you do not have access to a laptop, [you may request to borrow one from the university](https://it.uic.edu/services-support/student-resources/online-learning/).

### Course Description

Digital media - like Instagram photos, TikTok stories, Google searches, Buzzfeed and Boing Boing articles, Reddit threads, and WhatsApp messages - combines to form the vast majority of the content most of us create and consume every day. Existing digital media and the digitized versions of the old media before it are available to more people than ever before, while even more digital content is created each day than in the whole of human history up to the creation of the internet. Protests, social justice movements, and political campaigns are won or lost through online organization and the dissemination of viral digital media. And this list of influences digital media holds in our lives still continues to grow and grow. In the vast interconnected global village of the internet, who are we in relationship to and how do we thoughtfully read digital media? And, even more, what skills are most useful to strengthen our careers and communities, and lead our own creative endeavors and social movements in this media landscape? These are some of the primary questions we will be exploring in this digital practices course.

* Our course explores digital media as an art form, bringing it together with design, cultural and technology studies, and into an interactive, collaborative class.
* Our course is oriented toward making, writing, building and identifying relevant skills for a digital media toolkit and historical and theoretical introductions to practices that will be useful for creative and critical thinkers working across disciplines.
* This course is required for BA in IDEAS. Extensive computer use (and internet access) required.

***

### Course Outcomes

* Students will demonstrate a basic understanding of how key ideas of digital media practices in design and the arts are materialized through current digital media creation tools and their underlying social and technological systems.
* Students will demonstrate an understanding of digital media resources in design and the arts.
* Students will demonstrate an ability to use current creative digital media tools (purpose built or appropriated) and systems in design and the arts.
* Students will demonstrate a basic understanding of how digital media practices in design and the arts (including architectural, visual, environmental, theatrical, musical, and art historical) reflects and shapes technological and cultural conditions, including questions of community, personal narrative, privacy, and security.

***

### Assessment Methods

* Short projects and class readings will evaluate students’ understanding of how key ideas of digital media practices in design and arts disciplines are materialized through current digital tools and systems.
* Short projects will evaluate students’ understanding of digital media resources in design and arts disciplines.
* Short projects will evaluate the students’ ability to use current digital media tools and systems in design and arts disciplines.
* A website project will evaluate students’ ability to apply computer programming concepts.
* Assigned readings, videos to watch, and audio to listen to will challenge students to think critically about how digital media practices in design and the arts shape technological and cultural conditions in relation to questions of community, personal narrative, privacy, and security.

### Course Content and Materials

Pre-recorded lectures, texts, articles, videos, audio clips, as well as additional resources like example files and tutorials, can be accessed on the course GitHub repository under the folder for the current week. You will be responsible for watching, reading, and listening to each week's materials, as their content will be explored further in your weekly assignments and projects.

***

### Git, GitHub

We will make extensive use of Git and GitHub to post writing responses, project files, and as the central hub for course materials.

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a file management system primarily used by programmers in software development (and also used by artists, writers, designers, scientists, among many others) that allows them to manage their projects as "repositories" or all-inclusive packages that can be managed and new versions updated ("pushed" to a server) easily. [GitHub](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) is a web service that hosts these repositories. GitHub uses Git, but Git does not necessarily use GitHub.

A free GitHub account is required for this class. [Create an account here](https://github.com/join) and [email me at jkelle28@uic.edu](mailto:jkelle28@uic.edu) with your GitHub username.

### Assignments and Grading

There are 100 possible points you can earn from the following assignments:

* Github Poetry Project: 15 pts
* Green Screen Project: 20 pts
* Non-linear Narrative Project: 20 pts
* Final Portfolio Project: 25 pts
* Additional Written Responses: 20 pts

***

### Revision Policy

After you turn in projects and receive feedback, you will have the chance to revise your assignments using what you've learned. Revised projects can be submitted directly to me by pushing the updated changes to our GitHub repository.

***

### Course Expectations and Course Assignment Policy

This is a four hour course. You should expect to read, watch, or listen to around 4 hours of required course materials per week, in addition to the time it will take to complete assignments. Because of the pace of the course, completing assignments on time is crucial for success.

### COVID-19 Safety Protocols and Policies

General guidance for those attending in person classes:

Face Masks: Masks must be worn at all times by all students, faculty, and staff while on campus, whether in or out of class, in all offices, on all pathways, and inside and outside of all buildings, in accordance with University policies. If you do not wear a mask, you will be asked to leave the classroom and will not be allowed back in class unless or until you wear a mask. Eating and drinking is not allowed in classrooms.

Social Distancing: We all must maintain appropriate social distancing at all times, whether in or out of class, in all offices, on all pathways, and inside and outside of all buildings. On-campus classes are being held in classrooms that are large enough to maintain a minimum physical distance of 6 feet (or two arm’s length) between people; we will implement assigned seating to ensure social distancing is observed and also to make contact tracing easier if there is an incident of COVID-19 infection in our class.

Hand Washing, Sanitizing: Everyone is expected to wash or sanitize their hands before class, either by using personal sanitizer or by using one of the sanitizer dispensers located on campus. Please remember to wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds or more. If using hand sanitizer, please remember it should be at least 60% alcohol and you should rub your hands together until dry.
