# Project 4: Personal Portfolio
## Project Description and Criteria

**Due Thursday, April 29, 2021**

>#### portfolio (noun)
1. a large, thin, flat case for loose sheets of paper such as drawings or maps.  
 - "under her arm he carried a large portfolio of drawings"  
2. a set of pieces of creative work collected by someone to display their skills, especially to a potential employer.
 - "he had a portfolio of crayon portraits"

What is the purpose of a *portfolio*? A portfolio for artists, designers, and other media professionals is often *their proof of qualification* for a specific job, grant, or application.

Portfolios, depending on how they are organized, what work is included (and what work is *excluded*), and how the work is written about/explained are the primary means someone working in a visual field communicates why they should be considered or an opportunity. You are likely familiar with common types of portfolios (e.g. the artist's Instagram portfolio, or the web designer's portfolio).

### Goals

Create a personal portfolio using HTML/CSS and GitHub Pages that shows off the best parts of your Projects 1, 2, and 3 from this class, and optionally one additional project that you have done in another class or on your own.

Think about the organization for your portfolio.
- Will your projects appear all on the same page? Will they appear on different pages with different headings? Will they have a common menu bar or will the menu change with each new project. Is there a consistent design, or is there a concept in the portfolio itself that allows the design to change as the viewer goes through it?

Think about the requirements of each item in your portfolio
- Websites and videos require different kinds of presentation than static images.
- If you have a portfolio that includes a website you have designed (as in Project 1) how will you represent this website? Will you have a screenshot of the website that links to the "real thing" or will you just link directly to it when someone clicks on the website in the menu bar, or will you just have a description of it?
- If you have a video (especially one that exists in context to another medium, like in Project 2) will you show the video alone? Will the video have screenshots of what it looked like when it was played (like in a Zoom meeting for the Greenscreen Project)?
- If you have a game (as in Project 3) could the game be embedded directly on the website? Will there been screenshots of the game? Could you even have a photo of someone playing the game if you wanted to incorporate the documented experience of the game?

### Instructions

Using your Github Pages repository created originally in Project 1:
- Create a new folder named "personal-portfolio"
- Inside this folder create a new "index.html" file which will be the main page for your Personal Portfolio
- From this main page, link new pages for each *Projects 1, 2, and 3 and an optional additional project*
- In each new Project page include any images, videos, or sounds that demonstrate the ideal version of your project
- Push this new project to your Github Pages repository
- Email me the repository link

### Requirements

- Must include documentation of Projects 1, 2, and 3
- Must use HTML/CSS to create the web pages for each project
- Must be posted on Github Pages no later Thursday, April 28th
