# Project 1: GitHub Poetry

## Project Description and Criteria
**Due Thursday, February 11, 2021 (week 5)**

Read [K. Silem Mohammad's Spooked and Considering How Spooky Deer Are](/week_05_week_of_02-08-2021/readings/K-Silem-Mohammad-Spooked-and-Considering-How-Spooky-Deer-Are.pdf).

Consider what "uncreative writing" means, the rules of "flarf," and how it may be considered a type of generative web art. What kinds of webpages could be produced using randomized rules such as these? Using the Atom text editor and your GitHub account to create a Flarf poem based on these rules:

1. Do a google search of the last phrase you texted someone. Make sure it is more than one word. If your last text was something like "k" or "lol," check to see what your next-to-last text was, etc.
2. Paste the text result into a text editor, and cut and edit that phrase as you like. Don't forget a title.
3. Use that same Google search, and download 4 images from the first page of image results. Include them in an "img" folder.
4. Use that text and those images to create a flarf poem website. [Include an External CSS page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) to style it any way you like.
5. Upload (push) the page to GitHub, and make it available using GitHub pages.

## Setting up GitHub Pages

1. Use [this guide to create a new GitHub pages repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) and stop when you get to the "Creating your site" header
2. Clone your new GitHub Pages repository in Atom [using this tutorial from week 3](https://vimeo.com/454929880/e8fca32290) so you can create/edit files and push them to GitHub pages directly from Atom
3. Create two new files in Atom and save the first as "index.html" and the second as "style.css" and place them in the main folder of your new repository. Use what you learned in the [HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) to do Step 4 and 5 from the project description above
