# Project 3: Non-linear Narrative
## Project Description and Criteria

**Due Thursday, April 14 (week 14)**


Why might we tell a story out of order, or eschew the idea that a story could have an "order" in the first place? Often, new or strange concepts we encounter can be best understood if we look at them in a variety of ways, each with their own unique interpretations. It's often the case that no two people come to the same place of understanding in exactly the same way. A non-linear narrative leans on this idea as a feature, creating a rich world for players to explore on their way to a "destination", *or not*.

**Goals**

Create a non-linear game using Twine.

- Learn how to construct branching narratives/non-linear narratives for interactive play using simple coding techniques (involving Twine, adapting HTML, CSS, etc.)
- Practice creating different modes of interactivity through text and moving images
- Thinking through performance: interrogate notions of creating characters or portraiture
- Learn about different narrative structures (picaresque, gauntlet, quest, branch-and-bottleneck, etc.)
- Understand distinctions between “performance” and “performative”; critiquing types and effectiveness of interactivity
- Identify the strengths of the non-linear narrative game as a medium. Remember that all of its qualities (from the interactive selection of a path by the user, to the presentation of the game on a screen, to the mindset of someone interfacing with a medium that has these qualities) affects how the game will be experienced.

**Instructions**

Using [Twine](https://twinery.org/), write a branching story with one or more of the following features:
- Non-human (or better, non-animal) main character
- Events out of chronological order
- Multiple characters
- Poem, not prose
- Possibly avoid: life simulator, choose your own adventure tropes (walking around in a fictional world, fighting, dying etc.).

**Requirements**

- Use the Twine non-linear story platform to create a game.
- Use the Harlowe 3.0.1 format. This is in the settings tab. (We will be learning Harlowe markup in class. The reference page we will be using can be found here: https://twine2.neocities.org/.)
- You can use the downloaded or online version. If you use the online version, you will need to save your work by choosing the “Publish to File” option in the settings tab. This will download an .html file that can be opened on any computer.
- We will present these projects in Week 13.
